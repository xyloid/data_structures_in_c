Assignment 1 Exercises

In order to start thinking a bit algorithmically, modify this file and answer the following questions. Be sure to add/commit/push any changes made to this file to our repository.


1.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses could it take to get the right number if we had no hint at all? Explain.

Because we have no hint at all, in the worst case, we have to guess every possible number and the last guess is the right number, which means in our guessing game we have to make 10 guesses.


2.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses does it take to get the right number if we get a hint of 'higher or lower' when guessing numbers 1-10? *Hint* In your answer you might show this mathematically with the log function.

Because we get a hint of 'higher or lower', if we guess the middle number of the range, then we can shrink the range by half. After about log(10) (log base is 2) guesses, we can get the right number.
